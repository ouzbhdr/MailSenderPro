## 📥 How to Setup Gmail App Password (Required)
For security reasons, Gmail does not allow you to use your regular account password in third-party apps. You must generate a unique App Password:
Enable 2-Step Verification: Go to your Google Account Security settings and make sure 2-Step Verification is turned ON.
Access App Passwords: Search for "App Passwords" in the top search bar of your Google Account or find it under the 2-Step Verification section.
Generate: Select "Other (Custom name)", name it something like Python Mailer, and click Generate.
Copy & Use: Google will show you a 16-character code (e.g., abcd efgh ijkl mnop). Copy this code and use it as your password in the application.
Note: Do not share this 16-character code with anyone. It acts as a bypass for your account security for this specific app.

## 📦 Installation
Install requirements. Just run the code.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
